# **README Generator**
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT_License-green)

## Description
This project creates high quality README files based on what the user enters. This project gave me much needed practice in using backticks for string creation and manipulation. I really found it intuitive and it was way simpler than concatenation when you are dealing with data. This project also required me to import functions for the first time in Javascript, specifically: filesystem, inquirer, and my custom functions to format to markdown. This was very helpful and I greatly appreciated the ability to modularize my code more. I think it made the code far more readable and easier to navigate. Inquirer was a clean way to prompt user input in the command line so I was happy with that. I also learned that markdown was very sensitive to spacing, which I had to adjust in my generateMarkdown function so it would render properly. Lastly,this project was an opportunity for me to learn how to create badges with Shield.IO.

## Installation
This project requires node and inquirer to function properly. Node can be located at [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Inquirer can be found at [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) and downloaded.

## Usage
Once installed, the user needs to navigate to the folder with the '''index.js''' file in their code editor or terminal. Once there, the user needs to run '''node index.js''' in the terminal to begin the prompt section. At the end of the prompt section, the program will format the responses and then create a README.md file from said responses. The newly created README will be created in the same folder as the index.js file (current working directory).

## Contributions
I, Alex Messina, did most of the code logic and added the prompts for this project. The source code was originally taken from [potential-enigma](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma).

## Testing
No tests are needed for this project. You can easily see the prompts and will tell if the README.md is what you want by opening and looking at it.
